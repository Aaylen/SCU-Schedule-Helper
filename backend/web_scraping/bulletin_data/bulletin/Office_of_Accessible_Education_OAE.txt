The Office of Accessible Education is designated by the University to ensure disabled students have equitable access to all academic and University programs. We strive to support disabled students with, but not limited to, medical, physical, psychological, attention deficit, and learning disabilities, in participating fully in campus life, its programs, and activities. In an effort to build a more inclusive campus, we provide academic accommodations, support services, and disability-related educational programming for the SCU community. A student may register with the Office of Accessible Education by completing the online registration form and providing documentation of their disability, after which if appropriate, accommodations will be determined and implemented by the University.
