Gerontology is an interdisciplinary field focused on the study of older adults, typically defined as over age 65. Unlike other groups that experience bias and discrimination, if we’re fortunate to live this long, at some point we’ll all belong to this group. Discrimination endured by other groups (e.g., race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality) is compounded in the aging process impacting overall health, mental health, disease and longevity differently in the diverse groups.

Students who study gerontology at SCU gain hands-on experience working with and for older adults in the community and engage with intersections with diverse experiences first-hand. The skills gained are utilized in any career and personal journey through life.
