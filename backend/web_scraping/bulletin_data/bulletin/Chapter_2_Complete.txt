=== Chapter 2:  Transformative  Experiences  and  Learning  Resources ===

Santa Clara University is committed to the education of the whole person in the Jesuit and Catholic tradition, with a vision of developing people to be leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion. The undergraduate program is designed for students who seek an education that integrates Jesuit values and learning that prepares them for 21st-century challenges in a primarily residential setting. Varied educational experiences encourage students to value differing ways of knowing and being in the world, different forms of knowledge within established disciplines, and new knowledge as well as that which preceded it.

Santa Clara’s concept of the “whole person” inevitably embraces our social nature. When he inaugurated Santa Clara’s sesquicentennial year in 2000, Fr. Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, then superior general of the Society of Jesus, noted that “Tomorrow’s ‘whole person’ cannot be whole without an educated awareness of society and culture with which to contribute socially, generously, in the real world.” Affirming that the Jesuit educational standard must always “educate the whole person of solidarity for the real world,” he explained: “Students, in the course of their formation, must let the gritty reality of this world into their lives, so they can learn to feel it, think about it critically, respond to its suffering, and engage in it constructively. They should learn to perceive, think, judge, choose, and act for the rights of others, especially the disadvantaged and the oppressed.” Since then, Santa Clara University has revised the Core Curriculum, implemented a new Integrated Strategic Plan, extended the impact of its Centers of Excellence, and enhanced the University’s co-curricular programs, all with the goal of educating students who will apply what they are learning to constructive engagement with the gritty realities of the 21st century.

The Santa Clara undergraduate program offers courses and other learning experiences whose content and patterns combine the acquisition and creation of knowledge with the quest for meaning and purpose. Santa Clara’s learning environments encourage students to make connections across the Core Curriculum, the academic major, elective courses, and co-curricular experiences. Students are encouraged to relate their classroom learning with out-of-classroom learning through community-based education, Residential Learning Communities, Campus Ministry, a wide variety of student organizations, athletics and recreation, and other experiences. In a more general way, the undergraduate program nurtures students’ ability to knit the intellectual, social, moral, spiritual, creative, and behavioral aspects of life into a coherent and meaningful whole.


==================================================

=== The Core Curriculum ===

The Core Curriculum is a set of general education requirements that apply to all undergraduate students at Santa Clara University.

The goal of the Core Curriculum is to help students achieve a holistic Jesuit education that is built on three central learning goals: Knowledge, Habits of Mind and Heart, and Engagement with the World. In this way, the Core is a critical component of the mission, vision, and values of SCU.

Santa Clara’s Core Curriculum explicitly integrates three traditions of higher education. As a Catholic university, it is rooted in the tradition of pursuing an understanding of God through the free exercise of reason. As a Jesuit university, it promotes a humanistic education that leads toward ethical engagement with the world. As a comprehensive American university committed to liberal education, Santa Clara seeks to prepare its students for intelligent, responsible, and creative citizenship. Reflecting these traditions, the Core Curriculum provides every undergraduate with the common learning that all students need to become leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion.

The distinctiveness of a Santa Clara education emerges in the Core Curriculum, both in its sense of purpose rooted in the University’s traditions and in its commitment to a breadth of learning for the 21st century that complements and supports all majors. The Core Curriculum opens students to the study and practice of the arts, humanities, mathematics, technology, natural sciences, and social sciences. It educates students for interdisciplinary understanding and ethically informed participation in civic life.

Opportunities for experiential learning foster the development of compassion and attention to the ways human suffering can be alleviated. Reflecting the University’s founding mission, the Core Curriculum includes a disciplined and critical reflection on the religious dimensions of human existence. In addition, because the Core Curriculum continually highlights the critical and compelling questions facing individuals and communities, the Core Curriculum supports students both in making professional career choices and in discerning their larger vocation—their life’s purpose in the world.

Because a liberal education in the Jesuit tradition is oriented toward particular ends, the Core Curriculum affirms a set of central learning goals. These goals are divided among three broad categories: Knowledge, Habits of Mind and Heart, and Engagement with the World.

To be prepared for well-informed engagement in society, students must comprehend the forces that have shaped the world they have inherited and the ways the world is interpreted and understood. They must also understand how they might transform the world for the better. The Core Curriculum deepens students’ knowledge of the ideas and ways of knowing that emerge from the arts, humanities, and natural and social sciences.

Global Cultures: The intertwined development of global ideas, institutions, religions, and cultures, including Western cultures

Arts and Humanities: The production, interpretation, and social influence of the fine and performing arts, history, languages, literatures, philosophy, and religion

Scientific Inquiry: The principles of scientific inquiry and how they are applied in the natural and social sciences

Science and Technology: The formative influences, dynamics, social impacts, and ethical consequences of scientific and technological development

Diversity: Diverse human experiences, identities, and cultures within local and global societies, especially as formed by relations of power and privilege

Civic Life: The roles, rights, and responsibilities of citizens and institutions in societies and in the world

To contribute to a rapidly changing, complex, and interdependent world, students must develop ways of thinking, feeling, and acting that allow them to educate themselves for the rest of their lives with passion and purpose. By attending to the cognitive and affective dimensions of human experience, the Core Curriculum enables students to think more deeply, imagine more freely, and communicate more clearly.

Critical Thinking: The ability to identify, reflect upon, evaluate, integrate, and apply different types of information and knowledge to form independent judgments

Mathematics and Quantitative Reasoning: Analytical and logical thinking and the habit of drawing conclusions based on quantitative information

Complexity: An approach to understanding the world that appreciates ambiguity and nuance as well as clarity and precision

Ethical Reasoning: Drawing on ethical traditions to assess the consequences of individual and institutional decisions

Religious Reflection: Questioning and clarifying beliefs through critical inquiry into faith and the religious dimensions of human existence

Communication: Interacting effectively with different audiences, especially through writing, speech, and a second language

To engage with the world in meaningful ways, students need opportunities to explore and refine self-knowledge in relation to others. The Core Curriculum enhances students’ understanding of the integrity of their own lives and the dignity inherent in the lives of others, especially the impoverished, suffering, and marginalized.

Perspective: Seeking out the experience of different cultures and people, striving to view the world through their eyes

Collaboration: The capacity to collaborate intellectually and creatively with diverse people

Social Justice: Developing a disciplined sensibility toward the causes of human suffering and misery, and a sense of responsibility for addressing them

Civic Engagement: Addressing major contemporary social issues, including environmental sustainability and peaceful resolution of conflict, by participating actively as an informed citizen of society and the world

Each course in the Core Curriculum addresses at least three of the learning goals listed above. Students have multiple opportunities to encounter, practice, and master each learning goal. In addition, specific learning objectives for each area of the Core Curriculum have been developed by faculty Core Curriculum committees. These learning objectives are associated with particular learning goals and describe the knowledge, skills, and values students will be able to demonstrate after completing the courses in the Core Curriculum. The learning objectives are posted on the Core Curriculum website.

The structure of the Core features three phases designed to foster developmental learning and curricular coherence. The first phase, Foundations, consists of courses normally taken in the first year, introducing students to the processes and expectations for university-level education:

This phase helps students begin to set their own goals for learning, preparing them to make thoughtful choices in the Core Curriculum, their majors, and cocurricular activities.

The second phase, Explorations, offers students the opportunity to choose among courses that will expand and deepen their understanding of a broad range of subject areas needed for effective participation in contemporary life as well as satisfy requirements in students’ majors. Explorations requirements:

Students in Arts and Sciences and Business satisfy their Core Foundations and Explorations requirements with one course per Core area. Engineering students may satisfy more than one Core requirement with a single course when the course has been approved for both Core areas. Students who double major across schools/colleges must complete the Core requirements for each of their programs.

The third phase, Integrations, consists of these requirements:

These Core components are often embedded in courses students take to fulfill other requirements. These courses offer students the opportunity to examine the connections between courses in different disciplines, between the classroom and the wider community, and between their coursework and the professions.

Student progress through the Core Curriculum is not strictly sequential, from Foundations through Explorations to Integrations. While some courses (e.g., Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2; Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2; and Religion, Theology & Culture 1, 2, and 3) must be taken in sequence, all students have the opportunity to discover other sequences that are best for their individual undergraduate experience while engaging in coursework designed to address the shared set of learning objectives for each component of the Core Curriculum. Furthermore, the Integrations components of the Core Curriculum help students experience requirements not only as individual courses but as related educational activities that help structure and integrate their entire experience of University study.

The Core Curriculum website provides more detailed information about each component of the Core Curriculum, the learning goals and objectives associated with each component, the core policies, and the courses from which students may choose. Students are encouraged to check their Academic Progress Report in Workday regularly to determine their progress in the Core Curriculum and other academic requirements.

Students in the College of Arts and Sciences should consult Chapter 3 for the requirements for their majors. The Undergraduate Core Curriculum is designed to provide both a foundation and supplement to major requirements.

Leavey School of Business requirements determine how students in the business school satisfy some Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements—some Core Curriculum requirements are fulfilled with courses that also apply to the Business Core Curriculum. Students in the Leavey School of Business should consult Chapter 4 for a complete list of requirements for their majors and the school. The Core Curriculum website provides additional information.

Students in the School of Engineering are allowed more flexibility in their completion of Core requirements. Students in the School of Engineering should consult Chapter 5 for a complete list of requirements for their majors and the school. The Core Curriculum website provides additional information for how engineering students complete their Core requirements.

All students must satisfy the following Core requirements at Santa Clara University: Civic Engagement; Science, Technology & Society; Religion, Theology & Culture; Advanced Writing; Experiential Learning for Social Justice; and Pathways. For other Core requirements, it is possible for students to earn credit by taking Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses, or by completing college-level courses at another accredited institution.

Students admitted as first-year students must also satisfy Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2, Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2 with courses completed at Santa Clara University.

In contrast, students admitted as transfers are encouraged to complete Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2, and Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2, before their first quarter at Santa Clara. Information about possible substitutions for Critical Thinking & Writing and Cultures & Ideas courses is available in the Office of the Registrar.

Transfer students who enter the University with fewer than 44 units and incomplete CTW or C&I sequences must take both courses in the Critical Thinking & Writing 1 & 2 sequence and/or in the Cultures & Ideas 1 & 2 sequence.  Students matriculating with 44 or more units of transferable college credit, which does not include any AP or IB test credit, and have completed the first course in the sequence, will complete the sequence with an advanced course (either Cultures & Ideas 3 or Advanced Writing, depending on the sequence).

Transfer students who enter the University with fewer than 44 units must take all three Religion, Theology & Culture courses in sequential order. Students matriculating with 44 or more units of transferable college credit, which does not include any AP or IB test credit, must complete two courses from the Religion, Theology & Culture sequence in any order.

Transfer students must declare their Pathway by the end of their third quarter at SCU. Transfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with fewer than 44 units must take four courses (minimum of 16 units) toward the Pathways requirement. Transfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with more than 44 units must take three courses (minimum of 12 units) toward the Pathways requirement. All transfer students in the School of Engineering must take three courses (minimum of 12 units) toward the Pathways requirement.

After enrolling at Santa Clara, students can receive core credit for coursework completed at other colleges and universities for no up to 10 quarter units, subject to the limitation that no more than half of the total number of quarter units required for a Santa Clara degree can be earned at another institution.

Transfer credit for all coursework completed at other colleges and universities requires approval from the Office of the Registrar and the chair of the department offering the equivalent Santa Clara course. Students must earn a grade of “C” or better in a course for transfer credit to be granted. Courses taken on a pass/no pass or credit/no credit basis are not accepted as transfer credit (note below, the exception being made to Spring 2020 term course work). Grades for units earned at other institutions are not included in a student’s Santa Clara academic history or in the calculation of the Santa Clara grade point average.

(Note: Exception for Spring 2020 term: Regarding transfer credits for work completed in Spring Term 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, course work receiving a grade of Pass or Credit is transferable. We encourage students continuing on in those subject areas to consult with their departments and advisors to ensure they are adequately prepared for the next level courses.)

Students who transfer to Santa Clara University should consult Chapters 7 and 8 of this bulletin, as well as the chapter(s) relevant to their school or college.


==================================================

=== The  Residential  Experience ===

In support of the residential nature of Santa Clara, and the University’s commitment to integrated education, all unmarried, full-time undergraduate students are required to live on campus during their first and second years unless the student has been approved for an exception or space is not available to accommodate this requirement.

The undergraduate residence halls at Santa Clara University are home to eight themed Residential Learning Communities (RLCs), which were established to foster integrated education within a community of scholars. By creating a culture in which students connect their academic experiences with their social and residential ones, the learning communities enhance the education of the whole person and deepen the connection between learning and living as responsible members of a community. In addition to the RLCs, Santa Clara offers undergraduate housing in the University Villas, Nobili Hall, and Neighborhood Units. These communities, while not focused on a particular theme,  offer programming and a community culture.

All entering first-year students, whether or not they live on campus, become members of one of eight theme-based Residential Learning Communities. Nonresident first-year students are given access to the residence hall(s) where their learning community is located so that they can participate fully in its programs. In the theme-based learning communities, resident directors and faculty directors coordinate with spirituality facilitators and student staff to encourage academic achievement, community living, and individual development.

Students also interact directly with faculty and staff and participate in theme-based co-curricular and extracurricular activities across campus. All Residential Learning Communities are primarily two-year communities. University residence halls, which house the Residential Learning Communities, accommodate more than half of the undergraduate population in coeducational communities with common lounge areas, study rooms, kitchen and laundry facilities, and other services. Most residence halls offer traditional double-occupancy rooms with common bath facilities. Some halls offer suites and apartment-style accommodations with bathrooms en suite. All residence hall rooms and suites are equipped with cable television connections, Ethernet, and wireless network service.


==================================================

=== Campus  Ministry ===

The Office of Campus Ministry supports the faith and spirituality of all students at Santa Clara University.  Because  the University is grounded in the Catholic, Jesuit traditions, we welcome people of all faiths - those seeking a deeper relationship with God through their own faiths, as well as people seeking meaning and connection in their lives.  The professional ministry staff members are committed to building a campus community and supporting the full humanity of all people by fostering spirituality, wellness, and belonging. In addition to six full-time campus ministers, the office includes student ministry interns, spirituality facilitators in the residence halls, and desk assistants who foster hospitality. Our stance in Campus Ministry reflects our shared Jesuit that our faith comes alive when we work for justice in the world.

We invite students to get involved with these ministries to explore their own faith, spirituality, and values.  Additionally, students can develop their own leadership skills by serving and leading in all program areas, as volunteers, or in one of a number of paid internships.

Yes! Student years are a particularly rich time for learning about ourselves and our world and practicing what it means to live our commitments of faith and value more justly in the world. Campus Ministry welcomes all SCU community members to deepen their spiritual practice, faith and  identity, regardless of their tradition or personal stance.

“The real measure of a Jesuit education is who our students become.   Tomorrow’s ‘whole person’ cannot be whole without a well-educated solidarity… . the whole person in solidarity for the real world.”  - Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, Superior of the Society of Jesuits, speaking at Santa Clara University, October 2000.

Our only focus is to support SCU community members to explore the connection between their commitments and their actions -  to practice living faith and values more authentically ‘to build a more humane, just, and sustainable world.’


==================================================

=== Global  Engagement ===

Global Engagement includes International Students and Scholars and Study Abroad. Global Engagement’s mission is: To ignite curiosity and foster understanding about the world and SCU’s place in it by connecting students, faculty and staff through teaching, learning and research. In keeping with that mission, Global Engagement provides leadership, strategy and resources that support global diversity and learning at the University.  Global Engagement units include Study Abroad and International Students and Scholars.  Programs and initiatives include:  international partnerships, international programs, the Global Engagement Global Innovation Fellowship, the Global Community Engagement Fellowship, Global Internships, UK Fulbright Summer Programs, Virtual Global Internships, the International Studies Minor, and Faculty Fulbright grants.  In addition, the Associate Provost for International Programs works with departments across the University to develop global partnerships and programs, as well as to support university-sponsored international travel.

Global Engagement admits non-degree international students participating in an approved international partnership program.  Santa Clara does not have a part-time undergraduate program option and does not enroll non-degree students except through international partnership programs. International students participating in Santa Clara’s non-degree Exchange and Visiting programs apply through Global Engagement.  Applicants are expected to meet all prerequisites and requirements of the specific partnership.  Non-degree Exchange/Visiting students may enroll in undergraduate classes at Santa Clara if they are in good standing and meet all prerequisites required of the exchange agreement.  They are not eligible to audit classes.  See complete information: Incoming Exchange Student Program and in Chapter 8 on Non-degree Students.

International Students and Scholars (ISS) is part of Global Engagement, which provides leadership, strategic planning, coordination, and resources for expanding intercultural and international initiatives across campus to enhance global diversity.

Santa Clara University provides support for international students including immigration advising on F-1 and J-1 visas,  as well as intercultural and academic advising and career integration through academic internships and post-graduation employment.  International Students and Scholars also supports international students in other visa categories who wish to change their status to F-1, and international students who are Global Nomads: U.S. passport holders living abroad.

As soon as international students confirm their attendance at SCU, International Students and Scholars : a) provides initial documents to help students obtain their visa to attend SCU; b) helps students prepare for travel and arrival to the US; and c) advises students on academic planning, planning for internships, and post-graduation employment.

All international students are required to participate in International Student Welcome (ISW), a mandatory  orientation program for international students  that supplements the new student orientation program. Global Engagement provides regular programming to support international student success.  Examples of recent programming include immigration workshops, Employment Conference, the U.S. Cultural Conversations series, the iExchange program, and the international graduation reception.

Undergraduate non-degree international students are admitted to programs at the University through Global Engagement and should refer to complete information: Incoming Exchange Student Program and Chapter 8 on non-degree students..

International students considering withdrawing from the University should contact International Students and Scholars at iss@scu.edu to discuss how withdrawing will impact their immigration status.  See Chapter 8, Withdrawal from the University.

Santa Clara University provides students with opportunities to participate in a range of global study programs including:  semester or quarter-length study abroad; Global Explorations short-term faculty-led programs; the Global Engagement Innovation Fellowship; the Global Engagement Community Engagement Fellowship; Global Internships; UK Summer Fulbright and Virtual Programs. Programs are available during four terms: summer, fall, winter, and spring.

Santa Clara approved programs offer students opportunities to integrate with the host culture and foster personal reflection in the context of rigorous study. Programs may allow students to pursue independent research, attend classes with local students, participate in community-based learning, or gain professional experience through academic internships, which, in turn, can serve as a basis for senior capstone projects. For more information on Santa Clara’s Study Abroad and Global Programs, see Chapter 6 of this Bulletin.

==================================================

=== Intercollegiate Athletics ===

Santa Clara University supports a broad intercollegiate athletics program and is a Division I member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and a founding member of the West Coast Conference (WCC).  With 20 intercollegiate sports, Santa Clara fields men’s teams in baseball, basketball, cross country, track and field, golf, rowing, soccer, tennis, and water polo. The women compete in basketball, beach volleyball, cross country, track and field, golf, rowing, soccer, softball, tennis, volleyball, and water polo.

Santa Clara women’s soccer team is perennially among the nation’s elite.  On the heels of winning the 2020 National Championship and following up as the 2021 National Championship Semifinalist, the Broncos repeated as WCC Champions in 2022, their third-straight conference championship title and 13th overall. In the 2023 season, the Broncos qualified for the NCAA Tournament for the 33rd time in program history. Under the direction of head coach Jerry Smith, women’s soccer has appeared in 33 NCAA Tournaments, 12 College Cups, and won two National Championships (2001, 2020), becoming just the seventh program with two or more crowns. The Broncos’ 33 NCAA Tournament appearances are the third-most all-time in NCAA Division I, and their 12 trips to the College Cup is tied for the second-most all-time behind only North Carolina. Julie (Johnston) Ertz, Brandi Chastain, Aly Wagner, Leslie Osborne and Danielle Slaton are among the many former Santa Clara University players who have gone on to win medals at the Olympics and/or World Cup.

Men’s basketball has also achieved national success, having been to 11 NCAA Tournaments, including the 1952 Final Four, and seven other postseason appearances in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). Led by head coach Herb Sendek, the fourth   most winning coach in program history, and one of just three active men’s basketball coaches in the WCC with 500 career victories, Santa Clara posted their third-straight 20-win season in 2023-24. It is just the third time in program history in which they have posted 20 wins in three-consecutive seasons. Additionally, the Broncos have posted 20 or more wins in four of the last five seasons, which includes the shortened 2020-21 campaign. In 2022, the Broncos had one of their best seasons of recent history with a third-place finish in the WCC and a second-consecutive postseason appearance in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). The Broncos posted 23 regular-season victories, their most since 1968-69. Sophomore guard Brandin Podziemski was named WCC Co-Player of the Year as well as Newcomer of the Year, and went on to be selected by the Golden State Warriors with 19th overall selection in 2023 NBA Draft, giving the Broncos back-to-back first round selections. Jalen Williams was selected 12th overall in the 2022 draft by the Oklahoma City Thunder to become the Broncos’ first NBA draft pick since 1996, when Steve Nash was also selected in the first round. With Williams and Podziemski both selected inside the top 20 of their respective drafts, Santa Clara was one of just five programs (and the only one from the WCC) with multiple players selected in the top-20 of the 2022 and 2023 drafts. Santa Clara went to three NCAA tournaments during Nash’s four years on the Mission campus, including an upset of second-seeded Arizona in 1993. Nash would go on to become a two-time NBA MVP and is among the most decorated players in NBA history. Other former players include NBA champion Kurt Rambis and fourth-overall NBA draft pick, Ken Sears.

Men’s soccer was co-champions of the WCC in 2023, which was their 14th conference title in program history. In total, they have been to 21 NCAA Tournaments, five College Cups and took home a national title in 1989 when current head coach, Cameron Rast, was a star on the team.

Volleyball also competes among the nation’s best having been to the NCAA Tournament 16 times, including 13 in the last 23 seasons with the 2005 squad making it to the Final Four.

The women’s basketball program has made 13 postseason appearances, including in 2023-24 with a trip to the Women’s Basketball Invitation Tournament (WBIT). The Broncos won their first game of the tournament, giving them their first postseason victory since 1992. The current Head Coach, Bill Carr led the 2020-21 squad to the semifinals of the WCC Tournament for the first time since 2016 when the team qualified for the National Invitation Tournament (WNIT). Carr has more than 250 career wins as a college head coach and collected a pair of league coach of the year honors.

Not to be outdone, Bronco baseball was also crowned WCC Champions in 2023, winning the conference tournament and advancing to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1997. Pitcher Skylar Hales went on to be a fourth round pick in the 2023 MLB Draft by the Texas Rangers. In total, Santa Clara has been to 12 NCAA tournaments, including a trip to the 1962 College World Series title game. The team featured eight future major league players, including three who went straight to the major leagues. Overall, there have been 171 Broncos selected in the MLB draft. One of the most famous Santa Clara baseball players, Randy Winn, started as Nash’s backup as point guard on the basketball team before concentrating on the diamond. Winn played in 13 MLB seasons, including five for the San Francisco Giants.

Men’s track and field had its first student athlete in program history to reach the national championship, when Zach Litoff ran in the 3,000m steeplechase at the 2021 NCAA meet.

Santa Clara Athletics also supports the Ruff Riders, the official student fan club, and spirit groups, which include the dance team, pep band, and Bucky the Bronco.

The Broncos are fortunate to play in some of the best facilities on the West Coast:

=== University Honors Program ===

Vision: The honors program is a community of independent thinkers committed to the pursuit of academic excellence and global engagement.

Mission: The University Honors Program promotes intellectual excellence, critical thinking, and global engagement through seminar-style courses, difficult dialogues, and mentored independent research. Student-directed Honors programming builds community ties and fosters student leadership in the campus community and beyond.

The University Honors Program is the umbrella Honors Program for the entire University, providing Santa Clara’s most academically accomplished students with intellectual opportunities based in small, seminar-style classes, especially in courses fulfilling Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements. The UHP course of study combines broadly based, liberal learning with depth of specialization in a major field. UHP courses are designed to fit within the curricula of the humanities, natural and social sciences, business, and engineering. Possible majors include every undergraduate field in the University. With an average of 17 students each, seminars emphasize analytical rigor, effective expression, and interaction among professors and students. In the classroom and in the UHP community. UHP students enjoy a level of collaboration exceptional, even at Santa Clara University.

The University Honors Program features priority registration, housing in four of the eight RLCs, community events and conversations, a mentored yearlong senior thesis or project, and special fellowships and scholarships available only to Honors students.

The Honors Program admits 85 first-year students each fall into what is called Level I. Students apply after they have been admitted to SCU.  Level I includes a curriculum of nine Honors-level courses plus a senior thesis. See the UHP website for more detail.

First-year students who have established a grade point average of 3.75 after completing two full time quarters of study at Santa Clara may apply for admission to Level II. Applicants will be evaluated for entry into Level II based on academic performance, endorsements from two faculty members, and a short essay. To complete the Honors program, students must take Honors 20; one Honors RTC or Ethics; four Honors electives; and complete a senior thesis. Students must submit applications for Level II by the end of week 4 in the spring quarter of their first year. Level II application forms are available on the UHP website.

Students who transfer from another institution are encouraged to contact UHP to be considered for admission to the program as soon as they have been admitted to SCU, based on their prior academic record.

Honors is a selective program that admits a small group of students each year from across the University, approximately 5% of the incoming class. Although there is no minimum academic requirement to apply to the Honors program, our students are typically high achieving, have pursued a rigorous course curriculum in high school, and are engaged in a range of activities beyond their academic interests. We are seeking a diverse class that brings a variety of life experiences and perspectives to our community.


==================================================

=== LEAD Scholars Program ===

The LEAD (Leadership, Excellence, and Academic Development) Scholars Program provides first-generation college students admitted to the program with a foundation for their college success. The program forms a community of undergraduate peers, staff, and faculty dedicated to rigorous academic achievement, student leadership, and community engagement. The LEAD Scholars Program supports and challenges students throughout their time at SCU. The majority of LEAD Scholars join as incoming students and participate in LEAD Week, which takes place the week immediately preceding the beginning of the fall term. First-year students take ENGL 1A and 2A together, as well as two LEAD seminars, which focus on optimizing the transition to college. Transfer students take an upper-division seminar, which focuses on opportunities and challenges for transfer students. Current students can apply to join LEAD after they are enrolled at SCU and also take an upper-division seminar to maximize their SCU experience. The LEAD Scholars Program also requires students to take a vocational exploration course to help them prepare for life beyond graduation. Students who started at SCU in their first year, take this course in their sophomore or junior year. Transfer students take this course in their junior or senior year.

LEAD scholars can participate in LEAD student leadership positions, as well as a range of social and academic events, such as alumni networking, community-building events, and outreach to families and K–12 students. For more information about courses offered by the LEAD Scholars Program, see Chapter 6.


==================================================

=== Office of Student Fellowships ===

The Office of Student Fellowships (OSF) supports SCU students and alumni as they apply for a variety of awards that fund domestic and international independent research and travel, teaching, and post-baccalaureate work or study. OSF also coordinates internal review processes for fellowships that require a campus nomination, including the Rhodes, Marshall, and Fulbright for seniors and recent alumni, and the Truman, Goldwater, and Udall for sophomores and juniors.

OSF strives to make the entire university community aware of nationally competitive undergraduate scholarship opportunities and to facilitate successful applications. Through workshops, class and group presentations, email announcements, direct student contact, and collaboration with students, faculty, and staff, OSF 1) notifies students of specific fellowships opportunities, 2) fosters a comprehensive understanding of the fellowship process, 3) proactively identifies students whose qualifications and goals match specific opportunities, 4) encourages students to apply for nationally competitive scholarships that support their professional goals and academic interests, 5) mentors applicants throughout the process as they refine their materials, and 6) supports recommenders as they craft letters in support of fellowship applications.

OSF responds to two principles of Jesuit education. The first, cura personalis (care for the whole person), reflects a deep respect for the individual and that person’s potential. The second, magis (strive for excellence), calls on students to do their very best and always to strive for personal excellence.  With the help of OSF, fellowship applicants refine their future plans and goals, and hone their abilities to write and speak persuasively about their experiences and aspirations. While Santa Clara students and alumni have won awards such as Fulbright, Truman, Knight-Hennessy, Goldwater, Schwarzman, and Rhodes in recent years, the work of OSF is guided by the principle that the application process itself is a unique opportunity for personal growth and every student who pursues a fellowship will benefit from the experience of applying.

=== Peer  Educator  Program ===

Created in 1997 as an experiment in enhancing student learning, the Peer Educator Program is designed to facilitate and enrich the learning supported by undergraduate instruction at Santa Clara University. Peer educators are students who help a faculty member with the administration of a class and other activities that promote an effective learning environment. More specifically, the Peer Educator Program aims to:


==================================================

=== Domestic Public Sector Studies Programs ===

The Public Sector Studies Program at Santa Clara University offers an introduction to the areas traditionally known as public policy, public administration, and public affairs. It is designed to provide a closer look at the creation, implementation, and analysis of public policies, and the operation of government, public, and nonprofit organizations. The program also provides an excellent foundation for students who want to pursue graduate studies in public policy or public administration and an alternative perspective for students who wish to pursue public law. Political Science majors can complete a Public Sector Emphasis, which is a specialized concentration within the political science major designed to provide a closer look at the creation, implementation, and analysis of public policies, and the operation of governments and public organizations.

Through the Public Sector Studies Program in the Department of Political Science, students have the opportunity to participate in public sector internships and the Washington Semester Program, attend seminars at the Panetta Institute for Public Policy, and apply for the Panetta Institute Congressional Internship program. These programs offer preparation and training for students interested in working at the city, county, state, or federal level of government, in a public agency or nonprofit organization, or considering graduate-level studies in related fields.

Perhaps the best way to understand is by doing—students participating in public sector internships not only observe what happens in the “real world,” but they are able to take part as well, gaining invaluable experience and knowledge. Placements in public sector internships have included the San Jose mayor’s and City Council members’ offices, district offices of members of Congress and the California Legislature, government relations departments of high-tech corporations, public law offices including the Santa Clara county public defender and district attorney, political campaigns, and nonprofit organizations. Many students complete their internships with excellent employment prospects.

In the Washington Semester Program, students combine coursework taken at American University with hands-on experience via internships. In the past, SCU students have interned at the White House, the Justice Department, the FBI, interest groups, broadcast news stations, various nonprofit organizations, and offices of members of the U.S. House of Representatives. The Washington Semester Program offers students the opportunity to live, study, and work in our nation’s capital for one semester along with students from other U.S. states and from countries abroad. Numerous programs of study are available, including American politics and  U.S. foreign policy. Students participating in the Washington Semester Program earn up to 24 quarter credits for one semester of study. Grades and units received at American University will count toward the student’s SCU grade point average and the course requirements for the department and the University, when appropriate.

The Leon and Sylvia Panetta Institute for Public Policy at California State University, Monterey Bay, founded by Santa Clara political science alumnus Leon Panetta, offers an opportunity for students to gain an inside look at the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government and Washington, D.C., politics. This congressional internship begins with a two-week course at California State University, Monterey Bay, where students work directly with seasoned veterans examining the legislative process and its functions. The remaining two-and-a-half months of the internship are spent in Washington, D.C., working on Capitol Hill in the office of a member of the California congressional delegation. One exceptional Santa Clara University student is chosen each year for this fully subsidized internship.

To be eligible to participate in most of these public sector studies programs, students must have completed at least 88 quarter units of credit by the date that the program of study begins, must not be on academic or disciplinary probation, and must be in good financial standing with the University. Students must also meet grade point average and other eligibility requirements for the specific program.

For more information about the Public Sector Studies Program, contact the Political Science Department website.


==================================================

=== Academic Advising and Learning Resources ===

The John B. Drahmann Academic Advising and Learning Resources Center coordinates academic support services for undergraduate students. University advisors in the Drahmann Center work closely with faculty and staff in the Residential Learning Communities, the academic deans’ offices, the Cowell Center, the Career Center, the Office for Multicultural Learning, the Center for Student Involvement, and the Office of Student Life to ensure that academic advising and other academic support services are integrated for the benefit of students.

Santa Clara University follows a developmental advising model based on a close student-faculty advisor relationship intended to assist students with achieving their educational, career, and personal goals through the use of the full range of institutional resources. The Drahmann Center offers training for faculty advisors through new faculty advisor workshops and ongoing training to keep faculty advisors current on University policies and available resources. The Center also collaborates with other areas to enhance advising support for all students, such as providing technology support for the peer advising program in the School of Business.

The Drahmann Learning Resources Center offers drop-in group tutoring as well as individual tutoring appointments. Consultations and workshops on learning strategies, study skills, and time management provide students with additional support tailored to their specific needs. The Center also provides advising outreach for first-year and undeclared students and collaborates with the LEAD Scholars Program to ensure that first-generation college students are fully informed about the range of support services available to all students.

Santa Clara University has an excellent reputation for preparing students for careers in the health sciences. Most incoming students tend to be focused on either allopathic medicine or dentistry, but a much broader spectrum of careers can be equally or more attractive, including osteopathic medicine, physical therapy, optometry, pharmacy, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, public health professional, and others. A Santa Clara education provides ample opportunity to acquire the academic foundations in natural science required by medical schools, and its broad liberal arts Core Curriculum also serves to develop the communication, personal interaction, and analytical skills needed both during medical school and in one’s subsequent medical practice.

Although Santa Clara does not have a premed major, the courses prescribed by the Council of Education of the American Medical Association can be incorporated into several academic majors. In addition, many students become more skilled and competitive by enrolling in two or three upper-division science courses, often but not exclusively in biochemistry, genetics, and human physiology, which are helpful in preparing for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). The combination of Core Curriculum requirements with the University’s focus on community involvement and issues of diversity will prepare students well for the MCAT 2015, with its greater emphasis on social, economic, and psychological determinants of health. Students should visit the Pre-Health Advising website and maintain regular contact with the pre-health sciences advisor throughout their undergraduate years for assistance with adjusting to college academic rigor and social life; developing an appreciation of the wide array of available health care careers; achieving balance between academics, social life, work, health community volunteering, and internships; selecting relevant entrance examinations; and applying to graduate health-science programs.

Santa Clara University provides a wide range of opportunities for undergraduates to build a strong pre-law foundation. Early in their undergraduate program, pre-law students should consult not only with their major advisor but also with one of the designated pre-law advisors. Consultation with a pre-law advisor familiarizes the student with the rigors of law school, the practice of law, the burden of law school debt, and the means to best secure employment as an attorney. Advisors will help formulate a program to prepare students for the complexity of the application process, including preparation for the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). There is no specific major or curriculum required to qualify for law school admission. Successful law school applicants come from a diversity of majors, such as anthropology, philosophy, communication, political science, physics, English, history, biology, and economics. However, to successfully prepare for the LSAT, students are advised to select courses that deepen reading comprehension and promote logical reasoning. Law school admissions officers generally recommend undergraduate preparation by selecting a major that demands discipline, analytical ability, research skills, close reading of texts, creativity, verbal skills, and precision in written and oral work. The departments of philosophy and political science offer a pre-law emphasis within the major (in philosophy, it is also available within the minor). Elective courses also provide valuable training and breadth of academic and analytical experience. Some elective courses strengthen specific abilities, while others provide perspective on legal issues and topics. Recommended electives are located on the website.

Santa Clara University is accredited by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing to offer professional preparation for prospective elementary school, middle school, and senior high school teachers. The Department of Education in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology offers graduate programs for the multiple-subject credential for elementary grades and the single-subject credential for secondary grades, both with a cross-cultural language and academic development emphasis. The teaching credential program at SCU is combined with a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree. Students interested in teaching should consider completing an interdisciplinary minor in urban education offered through the College of Arts and Sciences.

The Future Teachers Project (FTP), formerly known as the Eastside Future Teachers Project, works with students from traditionally underrepresented groups throughout Silicon Valley and the greater Bay Area, who are interested in becoming teachers. Through innovative outreach and support programs, the goal is to develop leaders who will make an immediate impact on their communities. FTP scholars are generally recruited during high school and once at SCU, are considered for the FTP scholarship, which contributes to undergraduate studies and the credential/MAT program. The FTP is managed through the Child Studies Program.

For more information, see Chapter 3, Child Studies Program.
