The minor in Premodern Studies offers students from all departments a cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary program of study of the global premodern period between late antiquity and 1800. These periods lay on the edge of modernity, when the distinctive characteristics of the contemporary world began to form and when major new connections were made between Europe and Africa, the Middle East, East Asia, and the Americas. Study of these periods from many different points of view affords an opportunity to gain valuable perspectives on the ways that premodern people, events, and institutions helped to shape the modern world. Completion of the minor is noted on the student's transcript, and students receive a certificate acknowledging their accomplishment.

Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in Premodern Studies:

Directed reading and research in source materials and secondary works dealing with selected problems rooted in the premodern period, culminating in an interdisciplinary paper. Prerequisite: Permission of program director and instructor. (2-5 units)

Note: In addition to the courses listed below, certain sections of Cultures & Ideas 11A and 12A may be applied to the minor.
