The minor in Catholic studies, open to students from all departments, is an interdisciplinary program for the study of the intellectual tradition of the Catholic faith. The minor is designed for intensive study of Catholicism as a faith embedded in many cultures and for the critical retrieval of the Catholic intellectual tradition through dialogue with contemporary thought under the rubrics of a variety of academic disciplines. Catholic studies minors are assigned a faculty mentor who guides them through the program. In conjunction with the Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education, the Catholic Studies program sponsors intellectual, cultural, social, and religious opportunities for both students and faculty.

Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in Catholic studies:

Foundational Courses

Faith and Culture Courses

Colloquium Course:

At any point during their undergraduate studies, students may participate in an interdisciplinary introductory colloquium. This colloquium meets one quarter each year for discussion on a range of relevant topics pertinent to the Catholic intellectual tradition and Catholic imagination. While this course is open to all Santa Clara students, first priority is given to Catholic Studies minors. (2 units)
