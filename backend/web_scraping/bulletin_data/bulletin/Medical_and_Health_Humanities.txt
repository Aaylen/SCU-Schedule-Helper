Students in the Medical and Health Humanities minor apply the breadth of the Humanities to key questions and problems that define medicine and health. By exploring the history of medicine, narratives about sickness and health, religious and philosophical beliefs about disease and wellness, and the ethics of health care, students develop a deeper understanding of both the practices of medicine and health sciences as well as the experiences of illness and disability across cultures. Courses emphasize humanistic skills that graduate health and medical programs prize. This minor is open to students majoring in any discipline.
