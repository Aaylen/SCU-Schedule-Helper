The Santa Clara University Library is a central hub for students to study and collaborate. The library has a mix of both individual and group seating, group study rooms, computer labs, outside patios, as well as a cafe on the first floor. Throughout the year the library hosts events, art exhibits, and late-night hours. Library staff are available to support student research—there is a subject librarian for every discipline who can meet individually with students. The library staff are available in person at the Library Help Desk, by making an appointment online, or through our 24/7 chat service, “Ask a Librarian.” Learn more at https://askalibrarian.scu.edu/.

Library resources, which can be accessed within the library and remotely, include an online catalog (OSCAR), over 250 general and subject-specific databases, research guides for many subjects and some specific classes, and LINK+ and an interlibrary loan program. The library’s collection includes books, ebooks, magazines and journals, streaming videos, and more. Visit the University Library.
