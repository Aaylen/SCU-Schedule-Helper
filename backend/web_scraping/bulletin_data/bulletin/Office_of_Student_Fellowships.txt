The Office of Student Fellowships (OSF) supports SCU students and alumni as they apply for a variety of awards that fund domestic and international independent research and travel, teaching, and post-baccalaureate work or study. OSF also coordinates internal review processes for fellowships that require a campus nomination, including the Rhodes, Marshall, and Fulbright for seniors and recent alumni, and the Truman, Goldwater, and Udall for sophomores and juniors.

OSF strives to make the entire university community aware of nationally competitive undergraduate scholarship opportunities and to facilitate successful applications. Through workshops, class and group presentations, email announcements, direct student contact, and collaboration with students, faculty, and staff, OSF 1) notifies students of specific fellowships opportunities, 2) fosters a comprehensive understanding of the fellowship process, 3) proactively identifies students whose qualifications and goals match specific opportunities, 4) encourages students to apply for nationally competitive scholarships that support their professional goals and academic interests, 5) mentors applicants throughout the process as they refine their materials, and 6) supports recommenders as they craft letters in support of fellowship applications.

OSF responds to two principles of Jesuit education. The first, cura personalis (care for the whole person), reflects a deep respect for the individual and that person’s potential. The second, magis (strive for excellence), calls on students to do their very best and always to strive for personal excellence.  With the help of OSF, fellowship applicants refine their future plans and goals, and hone their abilities to write and speak persuasively about their experiences and aspirations. While Santa Clara students and alumni have won awards such as Fulbright, Truman, Knight-Hennessy, Goldwater, Schwarzman, and Rhodes in recent years, the work of OSF is guided by the principle that the application process itself is a unique opportunity for personal growth and every student who pursues a fellowship will benefit from the experience of applying.
