The Asian Studies minor is designed to provide an introduction to the cultures and languages of Asia. Courses in several disciplines enable students to sample different dimensions of Asian cultures, as well as focus on a specific area of interest. Students are strongly urged to spend a summer or quarter in one of the University-approved study abroad programs in Asia. Please note that courses about the Asian American experience are considered ethnic studies courses and do not count for the Asian Studies minor.

Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in Asian studies:

Culture Courses

Language Courses

Note: In addition to the courses listed below, many departments offer occasional special topics, directed reading, and seminar courses on Asian studies topics. Students should consult with the program director to determine the applicability of these courses, as well as study abroad courses, to the minor.
