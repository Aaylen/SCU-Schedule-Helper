The major program in history provides students with an understanding of the human experience through the analysis of evidence derived from both the recent and more distant past. As history majors, students learn essential skills, understand the breadth and similarities of the human experience, and acquire specific geographical and thematic knowledge. A degree in history provides excellent preparation for careers in education, journalism, media, government, law, business, and international affairs—all of which are careers that utilize the history major’s expertise in discovering, organizing, and analyzing the forces that shape the contemporary world.

In addition to fulfilling university Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in history will complete 13 history courses distributed in the following manner:

Honors in History

History majors may be selected for graduation with Honors in History provided they have a grade point average of 3.5 or higher in their history courses and complete a senior project (HIST 197) in a manner approved by the faculty honors committee.

Students may also qualify for Phi Alpha Theta, the international honor society in history, Phi Beta Kappa, Alpha Sigma Nu, and other academic honor societies, as well as the honors at graduation. For more details, see Chapters 8 and 10.

Directed Reading/Research

Students can complete directed reading/research (HIST 199) in source materials and secondary works dealing with selected historical problems in world and comparative history. Prerequisite: Permission of department chair and instructor.

Hybrid CoursesHybrid courses are offered throughout  the History Department. In our hybrid courses, students are offered the opportunity to study subject matter as lower-division students while learning alongside upper-division students. Lower-division hybrid courses are worth 4 units. Upper-division hybrid courses are worth 5 units. Upper-division hybrid courses require students to do more in depth subject matter exploration through additional assignments and instructor prompts.

Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in history:

A two-course sequence focusing on a major theme in human experience and culture over a significant period of time. Courses emphasize either broad global interconnections or the construction of Western culture in its global context. Courses may address such topics as civilization and the city; explorations, migrations, and nations; and empires and rights. Successful completion of C&I I (HIST 11A) is a prerequisite for C&I II (HIST 12A). (4 units each quarter)

An investigation of the diverse methods historians use to examine the past. Required of all majors. For history majors or with permission of the instructor. (5 units)

Researching and writing history papers. Required of all majors. For history majors and minors; majors will be given priority. Recommended to be taken in the sophomore or junior year. (5 units)

In this class, we will examine the histories and ideologies of human rights and humanitarianism; consider their underlying assumptions and power dynamics; and investigate the ways these histories relate to current legal, political, and humanitarian organizations and movements. This is a hybrid lower-division and upper-division course. Upper-division is listed as HIST 121(4 units)

This course will survey the impact of sexually transmitted infections in a variety of national contexts, from the early modern period to recent times. The focus is mainly upon the history of classic venereal diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea as well as more recently HIV/AIDS. How have medical debates about sexual contagion both influenced and been influenced by cultural conventions of blame, stigma, and moral judgment? Do representations of STDs provide a window into how a society organizes gendered expectations and constructs an image of deviant sexuality? How have responses to the problem of STDs changed over time? Can we examine these changes to better understand broader cultural adjustments to issues as diverse as prostitution and promiscuity, medical treatment and prophylaxis, and the politics of feminism, gay rights, and patients rights. This is a hybrid lower-division and upper-division course. Upper-division  is listed as HIST 124. (4 units)

Between 1789 and 1804, the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue was the site of the most profound and violent realization of the revolutionary spirit sweeping the Atlantic in the “age of democratic revolutions.” This era is usually associated with the French and American revolutions, both key events in the history of democracy and the rhetorical development of human rights as an agenda in the West. However, both stopped short of the most radical realization of the promises of the age of Enlightenment, particularly with regard to slavery and the racial discrimination that went along with it. The slave revolt on Saint-Domingue and the Haitian revolution, by contrast, witnessed the fullest realization of these promises in the form of the only successful slave revolt in human history. The events on Hispaniola took place at the nexus of world historical forces of globalization through commerce, cross-cultural encounter, racial mixing, and the dispersal of radical Enlightenment ideas and their realization in the form of revolution. As a result of the powerful currents of human history that flowed through the region, the Haitian revolution has proved to be an enduring source of both fear and creativity in the history of race relations, slavery, and abolition, and the forging of a new world identity for the descendants of the once enslaved populations of the island. This course will examine the history of the revolutionary years in Haiti, its near erasure from Western historical memory, and the literary and historical recovery of its importance in the 20th and 21st centuries. (4 units)

This course examines the dynamic and sustained relationship between Africa and the African Diaspora through the multiple lenses of African Diaspora of the Indian Ocean, U.S. Blacks, West Indian, Afro-Brazilian, Afro-European, and Afro-Cuban missions, travel, migration and repatriation to various locations in Africa. The course entails a consideration of the religious exchanges, ethnic/racial transformations, travel tropes, and discourses on Pan-African identity that characterized the Back to Africa Movement in various locations of the Atlantic World. It will introduce students to a historiography of Black Intellectuals, individuals, and groups who look to Africa as not a homeland, but as a site of Christian evangelization, trade, pursuit of freedom and social justice.  This is a hybrid lower-division and upper-division course.  Upper-division is  listed as HIST 157. Also cross-listed with ETHN 138. (4 Units)

History is not only an account of what happened, but also why things change.  This class will focus on the political, cultural and social events of 1968, both within and without the United States, and the legacies and ramifications for twenty-first century political culture.  A better comprehension of where we are at present comes from an understanding of the past. In addition to gaining some knowledge of history, the aim of this course is to help students improve their interpretive analyses and critical thinking skills through reading, writing, and class discussions.

The dignity of every human being and their inherent right to autonomy and freedom from undue suffering are much discussed in our interconnected world. Most people usually consider the goal of achieving universal human rights to be a timeless and generous ambition. In fact, however, contemporary articulations of human rights, as well as humanitarian efforts aimed at ameliorating suffering often in far distant locales have a particular history, rooted in both Enlightenment ideals of individual liberty and the modern experience of European imperialism. In this class we will examine the history and ideology of human rights and humanitarianism, as well as considering, through a series of historical and contemporary case studies, the underlying assumptions and power dynamics of these transnational ideals. This is a hybrid lower-division and upper-division course. Lower- division listed as HIST 21.(5 units)

An exploration of scientific, social, cultural, political, and ethical contexts in the history of infectious diseases and epidemics.

“Reproductive Justice” (RJ) was invented in 1994 by Black American feminists as a scholarly and organizing concept to analyze the intersection of reproductive rights and social justice. The study of RJ in historical and contemporary contexts now applies across borders and cultures, at the intersections—many of them transnational—of gender and sexuality, medicine, freedom and enslavement, ethnicities, eugenics and involuntary sterilization, the politics of birth control and abortion, the ownership of birthing bodies, and the global commercialization of child-rearing. This course will examine these global and intersectional issues from theoretical, empirical, and historical perspectives. Cross-listed with WGST 127 & ETHN 176. (5 units)

This course analyzes the diversity and complexity of Muslim cultures and societies in global affairs during the past two centuries. Special attention is paid to Muslims in Europe and the United States. (5 units)

This course examines the connections between two historical developments often treated separately: the US civil rights struggle and African anti-colonial movements. By placing these two movements in a transnational framework, the course explores the global challenge to the racialized world order of the 19th and early 20th century. How did the civil rights struggle gain momentum in the aftermath of World War II? What was the longer history and role of "Black Nationalism" and Pan-Africanism in the transnational struggle? What were the connections between the civil rights movement and contemporary independence movements in Africa and Asia? One of the central goals of the course is to show how we can expand our understanding of US history by reaching beyond the interaction between the US government and other nation states to examine political and cultural change.

World War I gave birth to a range of difficult questions regarding the relationship between democratic ideals and how societies organize for modern conflicts, setting a strong pattern for the 20th century and continuing to possess strong resonances for today. What strains and opportunities does war place upon democratic societies? Does modern patriotism enable or distort the aspirations of free societies? What forces propel individuals to assist or resist modern war making? This course encourages students to think of war as not an activity solely directed by generals and politicians, but rather a social and cultural event that is formed and negotiated by citizens, workers, and parents. This course places the World War I battlefront in the context of British imperial history, and especially examines how four years of fighting shaped Britain’s modern national and civic identity. Readings and materials cover the significance of the home front in many forms including the propaganda machine, the Irish problem, public school tradition, industrial organization and trade union activity, and the women’s vote campaign. Civic groups organized by peace protesters, conscientious objectors, suffragists, and striking workers will be explored alongside groups such as national service advocates, Empire leagues, Boys Scouts, and civil preparedness organizations.
