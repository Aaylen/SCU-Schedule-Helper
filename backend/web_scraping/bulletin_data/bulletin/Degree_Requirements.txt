Candidates for an undergraduate degree at Santa Clara University must complete all requirements for a bachelor’s degree as set forth by the University, their college or school, and academic departments or programs. Failure to understand those requirements does not relieve a student of their responsibility.

The requirements for a bachelor’s degree include:

Students must complete the requirements for a primary academic major in the College of Arts and Sciences, Leavey School of Business, or the School of Engineering, including the Core Curriculum and college or school requirements, to receive a bachelor’s degree. Requirements for academic majors can be found under the departmental listings in the chapters for each respective college or school.

Students must declare their primary academic major by the end of the sophomore year. Students may declare a major at the time of initial matriculation, except in the Leavey School of Business where declaration of a major is normally made during sophomore year. Students who initially matriculate without a declared major must obtain the approval of the department chair of the intended major and submit the online Program Petition form. Students participating in study abroad or domestic public sector study programs must declare a major before participating in the program.

Students may declare a second academic major in addition to their primary major; however, students in the Leavey School of Business may only declare a second major in the College of Arts and Sciences or the School of Engineering. Students who want to declare a second major must obtain the approval of the department chair of the intended major and the college/school for the second major if it is different from the student’s primary major and submit the online Program Petition form. To be awarded a second major, a student must complete all requirements of the Core Curriculum, college or school, and departmental requirements for that major. Requirements for a second major are as binding as those of a primary major and must be completed before a degree will be awarded. If a student decides to drop a second major, he or she must submit the online Program Petition form.

Students may declare an academic minor from among the departmental minors offered through the college or schools, the general minor in engineering, or one of the interdisciplinary minors offered by the University. Requirements for the academic minors can be found in the chapters of the respective college or school in this Bulletin.

Students who want to declare an academic minor must obtain the approval of the department chair or program director of the intended minor and submit a Program Petition form to the one-stop Enrollment Services Center. Some minors may require an application process and are limited based on space available. To be awarded a minor, a student must complete all requirements of the minor as prescribed. Requirements for a minor are binding and must be completed before a degree will be awarded. If a student decides to drop a minor, he or she must submit the online Program Petition form.

A student may earn a second bachelor’s degree at Santa Clara University, but may not duplicate a degree (i.e., bachelor of arts, bachelor of science in a natural science, bachelor of science in a social science, bachelor of science in commerce, bachelor of science in engineering). Students whose first degree is from Santa Clara and who are interested in pursuing a second bachelor’s degree concurrently or without interruption must have an academic record showing a strong probability of success and a proposed program of study for the second degree that fulfills the degree requirements in effect at their original date of matriculation. At least half of the units for the second degree must be in addition to those required for the first degree, and must be completed through a Santa Clara program. To pursue a second bachelor’s degree If a student is returning to the University after an absence, they must meet the criteria outlined above, but they are subject to the degree requirements in effect at the time of re-entry. Approval from the Office of the Registrar is required to resume studies for a second degree after an absence.

Students whose first degree is from an institution other than Santa Clara must submit a formal application for admission to the Office of Undergraduate Admission. The application must specify that the second degree will not duplicate any other degree. Students admitted for a second bachelor’s degree are subject to the degree requirements in effect at the time of admission. At least half the units required for the second bachelor’s degree must be earned through a Santa Clara program.

Candidates for a bachelor’s degree with a grade point average between 3.500 and 3.699 graduate cum laude (with honors); candidates with a grade point average between 3.700 and 3.899 graduate magna cum laude (with high honors); and candidates with a grade point average of 3.900 or higher graduate summa cum laude (with highest honors). For the purposes of calculating Latin honors, grade point averages are not rounded. Awarding of honors is based on all graded undergraduate courses attempted at Santa Clara University that are counted toward the fulfillment of a student’s degree. Honors will not be awarded above those merited by the student’s record at Santa Clara. An indication of honors at graduation contained in the commencement program is unofficial. The final determination will be made after a review of all completed undergraduate courses counted toward the degree.

To participate in commencement, candidates for a bachelor’s degree must have completed all degree requirements (or must be within the equivalent of one quarter – no more than 20 units – see conditions below) and a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 as well as a minimum 2.0 GPA in all courses in their academic major(s) and academic minor(s). Candidates must submit a Pre-Graduation Evaluation form, signed by the student’s academic department, to the Office of the Registrar. Candidates whose degrees will not be conferred in spring must clearly demonstrate that all coursework will be completed by the end of fall quarter immediately following June Commencement and must have the endorsement of their department.
