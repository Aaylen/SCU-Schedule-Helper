The Department of Art and Art History offers degree programs leading to the bachelor of arts in two undergraduate majors, art history and studio art, with courses in both disciplines building a thorough understanding of the history and practice of art. Department faculty encourage interdisciplinary connections with the Santa Clara community through course offerings that fulfill a wide range of college and undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements, as well as offering courses through the University Honors Program.

Art history majors at Santa Clara examine the broad range of human visual expression across space and time, developing understandings of the meanings and purposes of visual and material culture–including the visual arts–addressing their historical development, roles in society, and relationships to other fields in the humanities. The major foregrounds the visual realm of world culture, including the contributions of cultures and peoples whose cultures were grounded in visual and material artifacts, rather than texts. Students benefit from a program distinguished by excellent teaching and mentoring, challenging coursework, and opportunities for study abroad, peer educating, and internships at local and Bay Area institutions. The art history major features numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth that help students learn to think critically and communicate clearly. Advanced art history majors are encouraged to participate in our annual Art History Symposium and the Art History Research Paper Competition. The art history major develops skills in knowledge acquisition, critical thinking, analysis of visual objects and textual sources, cross-cultural proficiency, advanced research and writing, and sophisticated oral presentations. The cultural understanding and intellectual skills developed through the program enable art history majors to pursue a variety of interests in a wide spectrum of fields and professions, including graduate work in art history.

Studio art majors develop comprehensive skills that help prepare them for graduate study or careers in either the fine or commercial arts. Faculty members emphasize the development of conceptual and technical competence, as well as critical analysis of the student’s own work and that of others. By graduation, every studio art major develops a body of original artwork to be exhibited in a senior show for display in the department gallery space. In conjunction with the senior show, students are required to articulate an artist’s statement reflecting their own engagement with the creative process. Studio art majors enjoy opportunities to present their artwork in regional conferences as well as in student-organized exhibitions on and off campus. At the end of each academic year, students can submit work to the Annual Student Art Exhibit, which is judged by an outside professional in the field of art. The Department also oversees merit-based scholarships, which are awarded to outstanding studio art majors with junior standing.

In addition to fulfilling the undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in art history (ARTH) or studio art (ARTS) must complete the following departmental requirements:

On the long march from dynastic regime to global power, art made China modern on its own terms. In the 19th century writers, politicians, and revolutionaries looked to Japan and Europe to learn how art could renovate the nation. After WWI, leftists weaponized woodcuts and folk arts to combat the forces of Japan and the U.S.-backed Nationalists. At the dawn of the People’s Republic, art reorganized society and fueled radical conformity. As China globalized, artists cashed in on burgeoning markets, grappled with legacies, sounded alarms about oppression, and questioned “The Chinese Dream.” Fulfills the Studio Art program global emphasis course requirement and the Arts Management minor requirement. (4 units)

This course will take you through a survey of modern Indian art from the 19th to the 20th centuries. We will see how Indian artists engaged with and responded to modernity and the modernisms they encountered in the global art world, while working through late-colonial, post-independence, and contemporary Indian contexts. Early modern artists of the Bengal School of art grappled with the question of how to be modern and Indian in their search for an Indian-ness devoid of Western elements, while post-independence artists of the Progressive Artists Group could freely work with both Western modernism and Indian idioms toward self-expression. We will see how this trajectory moves into contemporary art and contextualizes feminism by reading about the works of women artists from varied backgrounds. Fulfills the Studio Art program global emphasis course requirement. Formerly ARTH 81. Not open to students who have taken ARTH 81. (4 units)

Across East Asia, artists and designers have fabricated landscapes to marshal natural forces for human-centered purposes. In China, visualizing Confucian and Daoist principles through paintings and gardens ordered society and cultivated individuals. In Korea, artists interpreted imported religions and philosophies through indigenous beliefs, giving birth to True View painting and seowon rural campuses. Japan’s native Shintō steered Buddhism in new directions, culminating in Zen and roji tea gardens. Today, these religions, philosophies, aesthetics, and practices remain vigorous, exerting themselves in art and landscape design worldwide, offering solutions to environmental challenges, and alternatives to the isolation of modern life. Fulfills the Studio Art program global emphasis course requirement. Also listed as RSOC 66. (4 units)

Fulfills the Studio Art program global emphasis course requirement. (4 units)

ARTH 83 Dance of the Gods: Art in South AsiaThis course will be a study of representations of dance in South Asian art. We will frame well-known examples of dance-themed art in their historical and religious contexts to understand the significance of performing arts in the design of sacred experiences. We will look at iconographies such as the dancing Shiva that have been sustained for over a thousand years to analyze their layered and shifting meanings over time. Such examples often communicate meanings about power, gender and culture, which we will explore through class readings and discussions. For the final assignment, students will work on a dance-themed South Asian or Southeast Asian art object that can be from an art museum or be part of a sacred space such as a Hindu temple.

What makes someone a “household name”? Is it talent, beauty, connections, or simply shrewd marketing? While fame, fortune, and celebrity may seem like modern phenomena, the cult of personality was equally prominent in Renaissance Florence. As is the case today, money played a key role in the arts. This course focuses on the ways in which the Medici family, through their social, financial, and spiritual support, transformed the city of Florence from an Italian commune with limited natural resources into the center of European culture. And in doing so, transformed the notion of the artist from that of mere craftsman to superstar. Additional topics of discussion include the influence of the capitalist economies on artistic production, domestic art, perceptions of the nude figure in religious paintings, the relationship between art and science, and the writings of Machiavelli. Fulfills the departmental Advanced Writing requirement. Cross-listed as HIST 125. (5 units)

The “Renaissance” has traditionally been viewed as a period of artistic and cultural development associated almost exclusively with the Italian peninsula in the 15th and 16th century. This same tradition privileges “high art”—that is, painting, sculpture, and architecture—over other forms of visual culture. This course seeks to reassess these notions by considering Italian Renaissance art within the context of early modern globalism. This reexamination likewise mandates a consideration of a broader spectrum of objects, including gemstones, glassware, and textiles. Topics such as the relationship between Michelangelo, Leonardo, and the Ottoman architect Sinan, the collection of Aztec feather paintings by the Medici family, and the influence of Egyptian mosque architecture on Venetian palace design will be examined from an interdisciplinary perspective. Fulfills the departmental Advanced Writing requirement. (5 units)

Fulfills the Studio Art program modern or contemporary emphasis course requirement. Prerequisite: completion of CTW2 or permission of instructor. (5 units)

From colonial times to the ongoing feminist revolution of the present, American women made, sold, collected, and supported visual art, and in so doing profoundly influenced the development of the nation’s culture, art, and art institutions. Students will learn about the roles of American women in the visual arts and the active interplay between issues embedded in art and in “craft”; women’s self-fashioning and the art market; images of women; and the impact of women’s studies and feminism on the study of the visual arts. Close readings of images and objects spanning traditional and nontraditional media such as painting, sculpture, photography, embroidery, and quilting produce insights into the dynamic relationships between gender and art, culture, and commerce in American history.

This course focuses on the visual culture created in the so-called "Gunpowder Empires," that is, the Ottoman, Mughal, and Safavid empires from approximately 1450-1700 CE.  At times interdependent, at times adversarial, but always in direct exchange with one another, these Islamic states controlled over one-third of the early modern globe.  Yet, with the notable exception of the Taj Mahal, the visual culture associated with these empires remains marginalized.  This course seeks to re-center the vast artistic and cultural production of the region. Thematically organized, the course will investigate the function of the urban centers of Istanbul (Turkey), Isfahan (Iran), and Fatehpur Sikri (India), the development of the global trade of luxury objects - including gemstones, ivory, and manuscripts; the development of leisure spaces, such as coffee houses and public gardens, as well a consideration of decorative arts including intarsia, tilework, and textiles.

For over a millennium, Japanese artists used pictorial narratives to circulate ideas and explore emotions. Buddhist biographies inspired devotion, while emaki handscrolls explored romantic longings hidden beneath courtly protocols. Explicit and grotesque visions of hell admonished men and women for separate sins. As Japan modernized, prints and manga celebrated urbanism and imperialism, and bore witness to atrocities. Inherent in these ancient and contemporary narratives are changing concepts of gender as artists have negotiated and challenged the dynamics between male and female authors and subjects, as well as universal themes and indigenous aesthetics. Fulfills the Studio Art program global emphasis course requirement and the Arts Management minor requirement. Prerequisite: Completion of CTW2 or permission of instructor.  (5 units)

Investigate the life cycles of cities in East Asia. Ancient capitals centralized realms, and later metropolises celebrated internationalism and stimulated the senses. Coastal cities sprang up under European colonialism, while 20th century capitals of Beijing and Tokyo modernized their respective nations and ascended the global stage by hosting the Olympics. Today's emergence of the "megapolis" calls into question the viability of cities even as "green cities" promise a sustainable future. From choosing a site to planning, from architecture to sensory experience, cities are where past and present co-exist and collide. Fulfills the Studio Art Program global emphasis course requirement. Prerequisite: Completion of CTW2 or permission of instructor. (5 units)

While these large-scale international exhibitions have become productive sites for viewing and thinking about contemporary art, they have also served to reinforce entrenched divisions between the center and periphery—which have in turn been challenged by counter-biennale models. These ideas will be discussed in relation to specific case studies on large-scale recurrent exhibitions. Fulfills the Arts Management minor requirement. (5 units)

This course will introduce prominent examples of Hindu temples built in the Indian subcontinent as well as few contemporary temples built outside India, specifically in the United States.
