      Thanks for downloading SCU Schedule Helper!

      It is optimal to use SCU Course Evaluations ratings over Rate My
      Professors ratings, since it has a larger sample size and is more
      accurate. However,
      <a href="https://www.scu.edu/apps/evaluations/"
        >https://www.scu.edu/apps/evaluations/</a
      >
      states that: <br /><br />
      "The Course Evaluations data presented on these pages are for use only by
      Santa Clara University (SCU) administrators, faculty, staff, and students.
      Any access of, distribution to, or use of this data by individuals or
      associations not directly affiliated with SCU, as mentioned above, is
      strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to electronic or
      hardcopy storage and distribution of these Course Evaluations data in
      whole or in part."

      If you would like to have the option to use SCU Course Evaluations ratings
      instead of Rate My Professors ratings, you can authorize yourself by
      clicking the button below and signing into a Santa Clara University
